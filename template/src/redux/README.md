# @redux

All `actions`, `reducers` and related files to `Redux` should be here.

We are using [Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/quick-start#purpose) simplify `Redux` interaction.

`RTK` is using [Immer JS](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) inside reducers so that you can mutate the state directly.
