This project is a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) boilerplate that can be used to kick-start a mobile application.

The boilerplate provides **an architecture optimized for building solid cross-platform mobile applications** through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic.
We made this full documentation so that each piece of code that lands in your application can be understood and used.

## Architecture üß±

The driving goal of the architecture of the boilerplate is separation of concerns and using React Native at its best.

- **Using modern Typescript**
  So many typescript features are indispensable now like hooks, functional component and really cool dependencies.

- **Presentational components are separated from containers**.

  Presentational components are small components that are concerned with _how things look_.
  Containers usually define whole application screens and are concerned with _how things work_: they include presentational components and wire everything together.

  If you are interested you can [read more about it here](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0).

- **State is managed using global [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) stores**.

  When applications grow, sharing state and its changes can become very hard. Questions like "How can I access this data?" or "When did this change?" are common, just like passing data around components just to be able to use it in nested components.

  With Redux, state is shared using global _stores_, and changes are predictable: _actions_ are applied by _reducers_ to the state. While the pattern can be a bit much for small projects, the clear separation of responsibilities and predictability helps with bigger applications.

## Content üß≥

The boilerplate contains:

- a [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) (v**0.65.1**) application (in "[ejected](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/EJECTING.md)" mode to allow using dependencies that rely on native code)
- a [clear forlder structure](#directory-layout) to provide a base architecture for your application
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (v**4.4.4**) to make components easier to read and understand
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (v**4.1.1**) to help manage state
- [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) (v**6.0.0**) to persist the Redux state
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) (v**6**) to handle routing and navigation in the app, with a splash screen setup by default
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) (v**1.6.1**) to make redux easier
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (v**0.21.4**) to make API calls
- [prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) preconfigured for React Native
- [react-native-flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) (v**2.0.0**) to debug react-native and [redux-flipper](https://github.com/jk-gan/redux-flipper) (v**1.4.2**) to debug redux
- [formik](https://formik.org/) (v**2.0.0**) build forms in React, without the tears
- [Reactotron](https://infinite.red/reactotron) (v**2.0.0**) inspect react native Apps with ease
- [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) (v**2.0.0**) the easiest way to build and release mobile apps.

The boilerplate includes an example (displaying fake user data) from UI components to the business logic. The example is easy to remove so that it doesn't get in the way.

## Folder Structure üóÇÔ∏è

- `src/assets`: assets (image, audio files, ...) used by the application
- `src/components`: presentational components
- `src/config`: configarations of the app like API's, KEYS, ENV's and more!
- `src/constants`: reusable text, variables, and etc.
- `src/core`: core UI, i.e. buttons, inputs, texts, themes, colors
- `src/hooks`: custom hooks of the project
- `src/navigation`: screen stacks and navigations
- `src/redux`: redux toolkit [slices, selectors and stores](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
- `src/screens`: container components, i.e. the application's screens
- `src/services`: application services, e.g. API clients
- `src/utils`: reusable functions like filter arrays, filter objects and more!
- `src/type`: reusable types for the entire app.

## Updates üïê

The boilerplate will follow new React-Native releases as soon as libraries and tools used here are compatible.
